# HoleFilling
Maven Java project to fill holes in a 2D image.

Won't be able to run this without also having OpenCV, JDK 13 and Media Feature Pack for Windows N installed.

Once OpenCV has been installed, makes sure there is an Environment Variable that points towards path/to/opencv/build/java/x64/

More details in the README.md provided with the zipped project + answers to the project questions.
